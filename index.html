        I graduate this semster in data science and start work as an analyst for an Arkansas convenience store company in June. I
        also study music, and you can look for me playing clarinet in the pit orchestra of the school opera "Mikado" next month.

      <p>My all-time favorite piece of media is the online short story <a href='https://www.sbnation.com/a/17776-football/'>17776: Football in the Future</a>
        by Jon Bois, and my goal with this web class is to start developing the tools to create works like this.

        BYU-Idaho's three-track system has been a huge blessing for me to build connections and expand my vision.
        I really want to keep contact with the good friends I've made here.

        I grew up in Chicago, Houston, Dallas, and Phoenix, but my family is moving to Idaho Falls next month! That'll be
        strange, but also really enjoyable.
